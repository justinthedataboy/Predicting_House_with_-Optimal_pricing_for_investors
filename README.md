Analyzing Airbnb and short-term rental (STR) data is all about helping investors make smarter decisions when buying properties for short-term rentals. The main goal is to avoid spending too much on properties that might not bring in good profits, which can help prevent potential losses.
The main goal of this analysis is identifying the most important factors that predict whether a property will do well as a short-term rental. These factors can be things like location, property size, pricing, amenities, and how the property has performed in the past.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a big part of this. It's like detective work with data. EDA helps investors dig deep into the data to find hidden patterns and insights that might not be obvious at first glance.
This kind of analysis isn't one-size-fits-all. It's tailored to what each investor wants. It's about finding the right balance between making money and dealing with the costs and risks.
